## Heart Disease Prediction
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease based on various attributes using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for this analysis is 'heart.csv'.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip:
## pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaorn scikit-learn

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Seaborn: For data visualization.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)Perform basic EDA to understand the data.
Display the first few rows of the dataset.
Show value counts of the target variable.
Calculate mean target by sex.
Plot count of target variable.
Plot count of sex variable.
Plot histogram of age.

## Model Building and Evaluation
